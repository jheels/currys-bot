# JBOT

Purchasing limited goods and electronics couldn't get any easier with JBOT, a simple yet effective software to buy items in seconds.

## What is it?

<ul>
  <li>It is an automation software that allows a pool of users to enter a queue</li>
  <li> They can submit their desired products from Currys.co.uk and their personal info. to a discord bot.</li>
  <li> They will be added to a queue where once it is their turn they will be notified and the software will attempt to purchase their products for them.</li>
  <li> Users do not need to enter their payment info since they have the option to choose Paypal or Credit Card and complete the checkout.</li>
</ul>

## How does it work?

<ol>
  <li> The user can request help by using the help command to see what each command will do.</li>
  <li> Once they have searched the Product IDs they want to purchase they enter the queue.</li>
  <li> They wil be prompted to give information to allow the software to checkout for them.</li>
  <li> They will be entered into the queue and given a queue number</li>
  <li> Once it is their turn they will be notified and the software will attempt to checkout for them</li>
  <li> If successful they will be sent a private checkout link to complete their payment</li>
 </ol>
 
 ## Getting Started
